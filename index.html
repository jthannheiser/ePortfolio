        My name is Joseph Thannheiser, I am 24 years old and currently studying Intro to IT and Intro to Programming online at RMIT. I was born in Brisbane, Australia and, until recently, have lived there my whole life. At the end of October 2020, I moved to Sydney to be with my partner when she secured full time employment with a fashion brand called bassike. We are getting a Scottish Shorthair kitten early next year which we have named Rudy – yes, he is adorable and will hopefully become my new study-buddy!

    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
      <h2>Personal Interest</h2>
        <p>
          IT has been something I have had an interest in my whole life. Some of my earliest memories are of playing videogames on the first PlayStation or of the day my sister won an Xbox in a school raffle. As I have gotten older, I have become increasingly involved with technology. I moved on from consoles and was eventually allowed to use the spare laptop towards the start of high school. It only took a couple Windows reinstallations before my parents decided to get me my own desktop PC to learn on (ruin). I learnt about the parts that made a PC run, how they plugged into each other and that I really wanted a graphics card so I could play Counter-Strike: Source. Shortly after that I became the resident IT expert which involved googling issues and restarting things until they worked. By the time I graduated high school, I had swapped and upgraded all the original parts of the first PC my parents had bought me. My experience in IT has been informal and largely dictated by my own curiosity and interests thus far. Now that I am studying at RMIT, I have been exposed to a whole range of interesting topics I had never considered before.
        </p>

      <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
        <p>
          With so many learning opportunities now available online because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be hard to decide on which university to choose. Personally, I signed up to study at RMIT with the help of a student advisor from Open Universities Australia and have been satisfied with the decision so far. It takes a while to adjust to online learning so figuring out how to navigate Canvas is very important. Fitting the webinars and content in with my schedule has been a breeze, with the added benefit of them also being interesting and engaging.
        </p>

      <h2>Expected Learning</h2>
        <p>
          My ideal job is within the field of IT, more specifically in cyber security. This university course will hopefully be the steppingstone I need to earn my Bachelor of IT with further postgraduate options to specialise in cyber security. Other than the obvious answer of what the course material outlines, I expect to learn how to work as a team and about what I want to explore as a career. Maybe cyber security is not as interesting as I originally thought, and I take a liking to software development instead. Whatever the future holds, I am excited to learn more about IT as society becomes increasingly reliant on it.
        </p>

      <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
        <p>
          At the time of writing this, my ideal job would be as a <a href="PenTest.pdf" target=_"blank">Penetration Tester</a>. This position requires you to:</p>
          <li>Attempt to gain access to a system or network via either complex computer-based methods or simpler methods i.e., social engineering. </li>
          <li>Review the source code of programs to identify potential weakness.</li>
          <li>Compile security reports for clients which outline suggestions and improvements to their networks.</li>
          <li>Be responsible for all the full implementation of solutions to client’s problems.</li>
        <p>
          I am most interested in the practical side of this job which requires you to gain access to a system or network. The challenge of this task requires you to think creatively and would be professionally and personally rewarding when your attempts are successful. It also helps that the average salary for these positions in Australia is about $90,000 a year with some positions in the ACT earning closer to $200,000 (Indeed, 2020). Other than having a degree and previous work experience in the   field of IT, penetration testing may also require additional qualifications depending on the job listing itself. InfoSec Careers Network (2020) lists the top 3 certificates to have in 2021 as the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) and Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) certificates. Currently, I have none of these certificates or the skills to obtain them which is why I am studying Intro to IT and Intro to     Programming. I plan to develop the skill base required for all of this during my university studies.

      <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
      <div class="Results">
      <img src="results.png" alt="Results of my tests">
      </div>
        <h2>Myer-Briggs</h2>
          <p>
            The results of the Myer-Briggs test are fairly accurate in my instance, and I believe them to be a true representation of my character. I see myself as an introverted person and keep a small group of friends. When I do go to parties or social events (which is rare) I either already know all the people there or stick to the ones I do. If I am presented with new information that I must learn, I focus on the details and prefer pragmatic demonstrations (16personalities, 2020). My ideas and thoughts are usually realistic, and I rely on first-hand experience where possible. I value how other people feel and constantly think about how I am perceived by them. In the case of judging versus prospecting/perceiving, my results were almost an equal split which I think is accurate. For example, Martin (1997) describes some true statements for judging types as; liking to have things decided, appearing task oriented and focusing so much on a goal as to miss new information. He also attributes the following to prospecting/perceiving types; appearing loose and casual, working in bursts of energy and being motivated by approaching deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The results of my Myer-Briggs test may have both a positive and negative effect on me in team scenarios. For example, I value other peoples’ feelings and how they view me which can be great motivation to complete work on time. I want everyone to get along and contribute evenly and expect them to hold me to the same degree of accountability. On the other hand, I can sometimes be too shy to speak up about things and instead take on extra work which as a result increases my levels of stress and may leave me unhappy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping all this in mind, there should be nothing to worry about when forming a group. I want to get along with everyone while also wanting the work to get done. As I prefer not to annoy or inconvenience people, I would want to get the work assigned done by the proposed deadlines. On the other hand, I can sometimes be too casual or quiet. As a result, I will have to be aware of my work ethic and not be afraid to speak up.
          </p>
        <h2>Learning Style</h2>
          <p>
            The results of my learning styles quiz seem to agree with my Myer-Briggs test results. University of Leicester (n.d.) state that pragmatic learners prefer to ‘put the learning into practice in the real world’ while the reflector style prefers to sit back and observe before acting. While these two learning styles may seem opposites, I think it is indeed a reflection of how I prefer to learn. If I already grasp a concept and am confident in what I have learned, I prefer a more pragmatic approach where I am able to see examples in real world situations so I can deepen my knowledge of the subject. However, if I am not as confident then I prefer the reflector style. This allows me to take a step back and think about what it is I have seen so far, to think about it more deeply and process that information into knowledge. Theorist learning styles are not as appealing to me, lesser is activist styles. These styles seem to be more about getting everyone involved in group activities. Activist learning is described by the University of Leicester (n.d.) as being centred around an individual which, as introverted person, just sounds stressful.
          </p>
          <p>
            As this test was about how I prefer to learn as opposed to how I behave or what my personality is, it does not affect my behaviour within a group as much. The other two tests I have provided results for are more behaviour focused, whereas this one describes how I like to learn. Though that is not to say it would not affect me at all – when researching a subject as a team, other members may prefer activist style learning which is my least preferred method. If I felt I was not taking in this information as well as I could, I may have to do some of my own research so I do not fall behind which is something I might have to be weary of when forming a group.
          </p>
          <p>
            My preferred learning styles are not a large factor that I need to consider when joining a group. As previously mentioned, the test is about how I prefer to learn as opposed to how I behave. Because of this, the result of my learning style test is not as big of a deal when compared to the Myer-Briggs or the big Five Factors test.
          </p>
        <h2>Big Five Factors</h2>
          <p>
            The Big Five Factors test focuses on five personality traits and gives you a rating from 0-100 in each. As can be seen from the results above, they are certainly in line with my Myer-Briggs result which makes me believe they are also an accurate representation of me. My first result in the Big Five shows my extroversion level at 6 out of 100, with the Myer-Briggs result showing a similar result of 85% introverted. Again, I see myself as a quiet person so agree with this result. My emotional stability, agreeableness and conscientiousness are all in the high 90’s which I would like to think is accurate. Hopefully due to my conscientiousness and agreeable nature, I will be an asset to any team or group I join.
          </p>
          <p>
            These results should have a positive effect on me in team situations, which is not to say there will be no negatives. I scored very highly in the agreeable field which coupled with my low extroversion score has the potential to make me accept suggestions from other members too easily. A positive would be my conscientiousness and emotional stability, both providing an enjoyable and stable working environment.
          </p>
          <p>
              Forming a group should be no problem for me as I do not mind adapting to new situations. I may have to remind myself it is okay to speak up if things are bothering me and would prefer someone else to take the lead. Overall, there should be nothing to worry about as long as all group members perform their tasks.
          </p>

      <h1>Project Idea</h1>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              From the start of this year till the end, the COVID-19 pandemic has remained as a constant throughout. A specific service that has been heavily affected are restaurants and cafes and because of social distancing requirements, there are limits on how many people can be in one establishment based on the relative size of the building. My project idea is a smartphone app to check how many people there may be at a particular restaurant or café, provide the user with an estimated wait time based on this data, and provide a way to virtually queue with the use of QR codes.
            </p>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
              If you have recently gone out to a café to sit down and have a meal, depending on the popularity of the place visited, you may have been told there was a wait time and asked to provide your name and number to be contacted when space is available. For some people, this could be a deciding factor in choosing where to eat. My app aims to assist people by showing approximate wait times and providing an easy way to queue for places that do not take bookings. With over 8000 cafes in Australia alone (Core List, 2020) patrons could enjoy a more hassle-free experience when choosing where to have coffee with the use of this app.
            </p>
          <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
              The name decided for the app is Waitr and as previously mentioned, it will provide a virtual queuing system as well as an estimated wait time. There will be two sections for the app, with the main components of the app being for the users and the section for business owners acting more behind-the-scenes. Upon first launch, users will be prompted to create an account using either their mobile number or email address, which will then send an account verification message to prevent the creation of spam accounts. Restaurants and cafes will have to opt in to use Waitr as a QR code is required on the premises to get into the queue. Account verification for business owners is crucial and may have to manually verified.
            </p>
            <p>
              The UI will consist of a slide out menu with access to account settings, recently visited, and a map showing restaurants/cafes near you with each having either a red, yellow, or green symbol showing how busy they are – red being the busiest and green being the least. Once the user reaches a restaurant, there could be a photo in the app showing where the QR code is located so they can scan into the queue. While in the virtual queue, the user can see what position they are in via the app itself. Ideally, there would also be a notification in the notification tray that is also present on the lock screen showing their position in the queue with push notifications letting the user know when they move up the queue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Waitr will also have a section to help improve the accuracy of the wait timer. If insufficient data can be collected from the Google Geolocation API, then the restaurant/cafe staff could assist in providing the wait time. Once they are let in, patrons could then confirm the accuracy of the wait time provided with the choice of three options: longer than expected, on time, or faster than expected. Once this choice is selected, the restaurant would have access to the user’s input to improve their estimate and the overall experience provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              To prevent attempts to get in the queue before the user reaches the establishment, location services could be paired with the use of the QR code. Alternatively, if there is an issue with the user’s device, staff could enter the user into the queue using either the user’s email or mobile number used when creating the account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, there would be the ‘recently visited’ section which shows the places recently checked into in chronological order. Other than tracking the places visited, it may also provide an average wait time based on the user’s last visits. It could also serve as a personal rating system, with the user being able to add comments about their recent trips for future reference.
            </p>
          <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
            <p>
              The obvious hardware requirement would be a smart phone with location services enabled. Waitr could also utilise Google’s Geolocation API to provide an approximate number of people like it does on Google Maps. The user could also contribute to the accuracy of Waitr by either confirming the wait time was as anticipated or giving a lower/higher amount. The results of these user answers, as well as the users account data could then be stored on an online database tool provided by Amazon or Google. As previously mentioned, there would also be a QR code component that would hook into the app and place you in a queue that is managed and viewable by the restaurant.
            </p>
          <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <p>
              The main software that would need to be written would be Waitr itself. Google’s Geolocation API utilises JSON as the data format, but it is ‘completely language independent’ (Introducing JSON, n.d.). The language JSON is based off is JavaScript which is an extremely popular language (Spinx Digital, 2020) and would be my choice when developing Waitr. The only programming language I have a basic understanding of is Java, so this may be out of reach at this current point in time.
            </p>
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
              If successful, this project will provide a way for people to check restaurant and café wait times, virtually queue, and be alerted when it is their turn to be seated. It may cause people to check out less popular places when they are presented with a thirty-minute wait time or let them spend the time they would have waited in a queue more productively e.g., grocery shopping or going for a walk. If this project succeeds, it will be a considerable quality-of-life improvement with queue times being made clearer while also providing a way for business to easily manage patrons.
